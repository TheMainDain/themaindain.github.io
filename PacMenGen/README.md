# Pacmen

Factory for making pacmen.
When the button "Add PacMan" is pressed a PacMan will be generated. This button will add as many PacMan as you want each time you click. 
When clicking the "Start" button, the Pacmen will start moving. Each time the "start" button is pressed, the pacmen will speed up. 
The Pacmen will then bounce off the walls of the window container.

# Future improvements
I'll be working on stylizing more and adding different themes and perhaps other pacman monsters.
