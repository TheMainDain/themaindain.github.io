# Bus Tracker of Boston Metro

This is a real time bus tracker of Boston, Massachusetts and the metro area. 
Click on the "track in real time" button to refresh the positions of each bus on the map. 
This is a true working bus tracker using API keys from MTBA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) and the Mapbox inventory. 

Enjoy!

# Future Improvements
I hope to figure out how to use the other map API's for my respective city (columbus, OH) so that I can perhaps show case my project more locally.
